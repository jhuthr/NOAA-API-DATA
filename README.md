# NOAA-API-DATA

This repo contains a simple python program written in Jupyter Notebooks to scrape and organize information from NOAA.

You can explore the website and API [here](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/).  

NOAA data allows you to access local water levels, tide and current predictions, and other oceanographic and meteorological conditions.
